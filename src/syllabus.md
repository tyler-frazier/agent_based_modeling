# DATA 444: Agent-Based Modelling

Course ID: DATA 444   
Course Attribute: COLL 400  
Title: Agent-Based Modeling: Simulating Human Development Processes from Neighborhood to Regional Scales  
Credit Hours: 3  
Meeting Times: TBD  
Location: ISC TBD  
Date: Fall Semester 2021

# Course Description

In this course, students will use openly accessible, global, near present-time, high-resolution satellite, household survey and CDR data, with machine learning and spatial statistics methodologies to construct agent-based models of human development processes. Each student will select and describe an administrative subdivision, its demographics, and its built and natural environments in order to estimate social and economic, complex and adapting, agent-based decision, movement and land use models. Students will construct modules that project demand for infrastructure (transportation, water, and electricity) and social services (health care, education, and public safety) as well as simulate an infectious disease outbreak, a natural disaster and unabated urbanization. The programming languages Python, R and Java will be used in this course.

Pre-requisite(s): CSCI 140 or CSCI 141 and DATA 310 and MATH 112 or MATH 132

# Courses Objectives

- To use state of the art data science methodologies to generate close-to-reality synthetic population data
- To use state of the art data science methods to accurately, spatially locate synthetically generated populations
- To use state of the art data science methods to recreate the natural and built environments where those populations reside
- To use state of the art data science methods to predict land use and transport activities
- To use state of the art data science methods to predict social service and infrastructure demand.

# Honor Code
Among our most significant traditions is the student-administered honor system. The Honor Code is an enduring tradition with a documented history that originates as far back as 1736. The essence of our honor system is individual responsibility. Today, students, such as yourself, administer the Honor pledge to each incoming student while also serving to educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students’ lives.

The Pledge

“As a member of the William and Mary community, I pledge on my honor not to lie, cheat, or steal, either in my academic or personal life. I understand that such acts violate the Honor Code and undermine the community of trust, of which we are all stewards.”

# Accessibility, Attendance & Universal Learning
William & Mary accommodates students with disabilities in accordance with federal laws and university policy. Any student who feels s/he may need an accommodation based on the impact of a learning, psychiatric, physical, or chronic health diagnosis should contact Student Accessibility Services staff at 757-221-2509 or at sas@wm.edu to determine if accommodations are warranted and to obtain an official letter of accommodation. For more information, please see www.wm.edu/sas.

I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning. Active, thoughtful, and respectful participation in all aspects of the course will make our time together as productive and engaging as possible.
